# Connect 4 Game

This is a Connect 4 game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. This project was created as part of my AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) creative task. Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game, in which players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Features

- Player vs AI gameplay
- AI uses a search algorithm to determine the best move
- Game alternates turns between Player 1 (human) and Player 2 (AI)

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 and Pygame installed on your machine.
